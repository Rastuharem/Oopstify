## Disclaimer
This project represents music musical striming service, which has such functions as
* Loading music list from server
* Playing and stopping music chosen by user
* Downloading chosen music
* Relocate to any timing in track by clicking on progress bar
* Changing volume of playing music
* Sorting by index, track name or author name
* Adding user's own music to list and saving it
* Some animations and other aesthetics
This is study project and it was inspired by Spotify. Author does not want to make any money or hype on it.
All music was taken from other open sources.

## Some notes
* Some songs could not be working, because of deleted or changed links. If you really want song to work - you need to find new link to it and paste it in music list or upload them from your pc
* Playing songs from your pc can't work directly due to Chrome safety rules: you can disable it in your browser (which i won't reccomend to do) or use http-server lib
